/* SAMV71-XULT DMA Channel Mapping
 *
 * SAMV71 uses XDMAC (eXtended DMA Controller)
 * DMA channels are dynamically allocated by the XDMAC driver
 *
 * This file is a placeholder for future DMA optimizations.
 * SAMV71 XDMAC provides 24 DMA channels that are automatically
 * managed by NuttX peripheral drivers.
 */

// DMA configuration is handled automatically by SAMV7 XDMAC driver
// No explicit channel mapping required for basic operation
