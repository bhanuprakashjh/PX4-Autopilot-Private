This repository holds the [PX4](http://px4.io) flight control solution for drones, with the main applications located in the [src/modules](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/tree/main/src/modules) directory. It also contains the PX4 Drone Middleware Platform, which provides drivers and middleware to run drones.

PX4 is highly portable, OS-independent and supports Linux, NuttX and MacOS out of the box.

## Custom Board Support: ATSAMV71-XULT

This repository includes support for the **Microchip ATSAMV71-XULT development board** with Click sensor boards for drone flight control applications.

### Hardware Configuration
- **MCU:** ATSAMV71Q21B (ARM Cortex-M7 @ 300MHz)
- **Flash:** 2MB (40.97% used = 859KB firmware)
- **RAM:** 384KB (5.60% used = 22KB)
- **Sensors:** ICM20689 IMU, AK09916 magnetometer, DPS310 barometer (via MikroElektronika Click boards)

### Build Status
✅ **Firmware builds successfully** (commit: 7afa7db)
- Binary size: 859,184 bytes
- Build system: CMake + Ninja with NuttX RTOS
- Target: `make microchip_samv71-xult-clickboards_default`

### Features Implemented
- GPIO interrupt support for sensor DRDY signals
- ADC battery monitoring (voltage/current sensing)
- I2C bus configuration (TWIHS0 for external sensors)
- High-resolution timer (HRT) using TC0
- USB CDC/ACM serial console
- Linker script for SAMV71Q21B memory layout
- Board identity and MCU version detection

### Known Limitations
⚠️ **Not Yet Implemented:**
- PWM outputs (timer configuration empty - cannot control motors/servos)
- SPI device configuration (waiting for hardware testing)
- GPIO pin mappings are placeholders (need schematic verification)
- USB VBUS detection stubbed

⏳ **Hardware Testing Pending:**
- Serial console verification
- I2C bus detection
- Sensor integration
- Full system testing

### Documentation
For detailed porting notes, build instructions, and development roadmap, see:
- [boards/microchip/samv71-xult-clickboards/PORTING_NOTES.md](boards/microchip/samv71-xult-clickboards/PORTING_NOTES.md)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Build firmware
make microchip_samv71-xult-clickboards_default

# Flash via BOSSA bootloader (requires SAM-BA mode)
cd build/microchip_samv71-xult-clickboards_default
sudo bossac -e -w -v -b -R -p /dev/ttyACM0 microchip_samv71-xult-clickboards_default.bin

# Connect serial console (57600 baud)
minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 57600
```

## Releases

Release notes and supporting information for PX4 releases can be found on the [Developer Guide](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/releases/).

## Building a PX4 based drone, rover, boat or robot

The [PX4 User Guide](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/) explains how to assemble [supported vehicles](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/airframes/airframe_reference.html) and fly drones with PX4. See the [forum and chat](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/#getting-help) if you need help!


## Changing Code and Contributing

This [Developer Guide](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/development/development.html) is for software developers who want to modify the flight stack and middleware (e.g. to add new flight modes), hardware integrators who want to support new flight controller boards and peripherals, and anyone who wants to get PX4 working on a new (unsupported) airframe/vehicle.

Developers should read the [Guide for Contributions](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/contribute/).
See the [forum and chat](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/#getting-help) if you need help!


## Weekly Dev Call

The PX4 Dev Team syncs up on a [weekly dev call](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/contribute/).

> **Note** The dev call is open to all interested developers (not just the core dev team). This is a great opportunity to meet the team and contribute to the ongoing development of the platform. It includes a QA session for newcomers. All regular calls are listed in the [Dronecode calendar](https://www.dronecode.org/calendar/).


## Maintenance Team
