## Detailed Bug Reports and Fixes

### Bug #1: Missing D-Cache Invalidation for DMA Receive

**File:** `platforms/nuttx/NuttX/nuttx/arch/arm/src/samv7/sam_hsmci.c`
**Line:** 3104 (after fix)
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** File system corruption, read errors, DMA failures

**Root Cause:**
The SAMV7 Cortex-M7 has a 32-byte data cache. Before DMA receive (peripheral→memory), the cache must be invalidated to prevent the CPU from reading stale cached data instead of fresh data written by DMA.

**Symptoms:**
- Random data corruption
- File system mount failures
- Inconsistent DMA transfer results

**Fix Applied:**
```c
/* FIX #1: Invalidate D-cache for DMA receive buffer
 * CRITICAL: Must invalidate cache BEFORE DMA receive starts.
 * This ensures the CPU reads fresh data from RAM (written by DMA)
 * instead of stale data from the cache.
 * Without this, file system corruption and read errors occur.
 * Reference: STM32H7 driver stm32_dmarecvsetup()
 */

up_invalidate_dcache((uintptr_t)buffer, (uintptr_t)buffer + buflen);
```

**Verification:**
- Added to `sam_dmarecvsetup()` function at line 3104
- Matches pattern used in STM32H7 driver (known working)
- Essential for cache coherency on Cortex-M7 with data cache

---

### Bug #2: Premature BLKR Register Clearing

**File:** `platforms/nuttx/NuttX/nuttx/arch/arm/src/samv7/sam_hsmci.c`
**Line:** 1496 (removed)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** Block parameters lost during command sequences

**Root Cause:**
`sam_notransfer()` was clearing the BLKR (Block Register) after every command, even though block parameters should persist until the next block setup. This caused block size/count to be lost during multi-step card operations.

**Symptoms:**
- CMD17 (READ_SINGLE_BLOCK) failing
- DMA setup seeing BLKR=0
- "Invalid block parameters" errors

**Fix Applied:**
```c
/* FIX #2: DO NOT clear BLKR - values persist until next block setup
 * The BLKR register (block length and count) should remain valid
 * across multiple commands in a block transfer sequence.
 * Clearing it here breaks CMD17/CMD18 read operations.
 * REMOVED: sam_putreg(priv, 0, SAM_HSMCI_BLKR_OFFSET);
 */
```

**Verification:**
- Comment added at line 1496
- Original clearing code removed
- BLKR values now persist as designed

---

### Bug #3: Duplicate BLKR Writes in Command Send

**File:** `platforms/nuttx/NuttX/nuttx/arch/arm/src/samv7/sam_hsmci.c`
**Lines:** 2148-2165 (removed)
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Race conditions, register conflicts

**Root Cause:**
`sam_sendcmd()` was writing to BLKR register even though `sam_blocksetup()` is the designated function for setting block parameters. This created:
1. Race conditions between command and block setup
2. Potential register conflicts
3. Violated single-responsibility principle

**Symptoms:**
- Inconsistent block parameter values
- Timing-dependent failures
- DMA setup seeing wrong BLKR values

**Fix Applied:**
```c
/* FIX #3: DO NOT write BLKR in sendcmd - it should only be written by
 * sam_blocksetup(). CommandSend should only write ARGR and CMDR.
 * This eliminates race conditions and ensures block parameters are
 * set exactly once per transfer by the designated function.
 * REMOVED: Two duplicate BLKR write blocks (18 lines total)
 */
```

**Verification:**
- Removed lines 2148-2165
- BLKR now only written by `sam_blocksetup()` at line 2218
- Follows single-source-of-truth pattern

---

### Bug #4: Reading Cleared BLKR in RX DMA Setup

**File:** `platforms/nuttx/NuttX/nuttx/arch/arm/src/samv7/sam_hsmci.c`
**Lines:** 3111-3112 (after fix)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** DMA configured with wrong block parameters

**Root Cause:**
`sam_dmarecvsetup()` was reading BLKR from hardware to get block parameters, but BLKR could have been cleared by Bug #2. Combined with Bug #2, this caused DMA setup to fail.

**Symptoms:**
- DMA configured with blocksize=0
- "Invalid block parameters" errors
- DMA timeout because transfer size was wrong

**Fix Applied:**
```c
/* FIX #4: Use cached block parameters set by sam_blocksetup() earlier.
 * DO NOT read hardware BLKR register - it may have been cleared.
 * This matches STM32H7 pattern which uses cached blocksize directly.
 */

blocksize = priv->blocklen;
nblocks   = priv->nblocks;
```

**Verification:**
- Uses cached values from `priv` structure
- Matches STM32H7 driver pattern
- Works with Fix #2 (BLKR not cleared)

---

### Bug #5: Reading Cleared BLKR in TX DMA Setup

**File:** `platforms/nuttx/NuttX/nuttx/arch/arm/src/samv7/sam_hsmci.c`
**Lines:** 3228-3229 (after fix)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** DMA configured with wrong block parameters (TX side)

**Root Cause:**
Same as Bug #4 but for transmit DMA. `sam_dmasendsetup()` was reading BLKR from hardware instead of using cached values.

**Symptoms:**
- TX DMA configured with blocksize=0
- Write operations failing
- DMA timeout on write

**Fix Applied:**
```c
/* FIX #5: Use cached block parameters set by sam_blocksetup() earlier.
 * DO NOT read hardware BLKR register - it may have been cleared.
 * This matches the RX DMA fix and ensures consistent behavior.
 */

blocksize = priv->blocklen;
nblocks   = priv->nblocks;
```

**Verification:**
- Symmetric to Fix #4 (RX DMA)
- Uses cached values from `priv` structure
- Eliminates BLKR read dependency

---

### Bug #6: BLKR Hardware Register Field Definitions Swapped

**File:** `platforms/nuttx/NuttX/nuttx/arch/arm/src/samv7/hardware/sam_hsmci.h`
**Lines:** Updated field shift definitions
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Block length and count byte-swapped in register

**Root Cause:**
The hardware register header had BLKR field definitions BACKWARDS compared to the SAMV71 datasheet:
- BLKLEN should be bits 0-15 but was defined at bits 16-31
- BCNT should be bits 16-31 but was defined at bits 0-15

This caused values like (8 bytes, 1 block) to be written as `0x00080001` instead of `0x00010008`.

**Symptoms:**
- BLKR showing `0x00080001` for 8-byte, 1-block transfer (expected `0x00010008`)
- BLKR showing `0x02000001` for 512-byte, 1-block transfer (expected `0x00010200`)
- SD card timing out because hardware saw wrong block size

**Fix Applied:**
```c
/* HSMCI Block Register */

/* FIX #6: Corrected BLKR field positions per SAMV71 datasheet
 * BLKLEN is bits 0-15, BCNT is bits 16-31 (NuttX had these swapped!)
 */
#define HSMCI_BLKR_BLKLEN_SHIFT       (0)       /* Bits 0-15: Data Block Length */
#define HSMCI_BLKR_BLKLEN_MASK        (0xffff << HSMCI_BLKR_BLKLEN_SHIFT)
#  define HSMCI_BLKR_BLKLEN(n)        ((uint32_t)(n) << HSMCI_BLKR_BLKLEN_SHIFT)
#define HSMCI_BLKR_BCNT_SHIFT         (16)      /* Bits 16-31: MMC/SDIO Block Count - SDIO Byte Count */
#define HSMCI_BLKR_BCNT_MASK          (0xffff << HSMCI_BLKR_BCNT_SHIFT)
#  define HSMCI_BLKR_BCNT(n)          ((uint32_t)(n) << HSMCI_BLKR_BCNT_SHIFT)
```

**BEFORE (WRONG):**
- `HSMCI_BLKR_BCNT_SHIFT = (0)` - Block count in bits 0-15
- `HSMCI_BLKR_BLKLEN_SHIFT = (16)` - Block length in bits 16-31

**AFTER (CORRECT):**
- `HSMCI_BLKR_BLKLEN_SHIFT = (0)` - Block length in bits 0-15
- `HSMCI_BLKR_BCNT_SHIFT = (16)` - Block count in bits 16-31

**Verification:**
- Verified against SAMV71 datasheet (Rev. J) section 45.9.9
- Verified against Microchip Harmony CSP PLIB headers
- Test shows correct BLKR values after fix

**Test Results:**
- Before Fix #6: `BLKR=0x00080001` for 8-byte, 1-block
- After Fix #6: `BLKR=0x00010008` ✓ CORRECT

### Bug #7: Wrong Cache Operation in XDMAC RX Setup

**File:** `platforms/nuttx/NuttX/nuttx/arch/arm/src/samv7/sam_xdmac.c`
**Line:** 2016 (after fix)
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Cache incoherency, DMA timeout

**Root Cause:**
The XDMAC driver was calling `up_clean_dcache()` for **receive** DMA (peripheral→memory), but clean is the WRONG operation for RX:
- **Clean** = Write dirty cache lines to memory (for TX: memory→peripheral)
- **Invalidate** = Discard cache lines (for RX: peripheral→memory)

This was re-allocating cache lines AFTER Fix #1 invalidated them, causing cache/memory incoherency.

**Symptoms:**
- 8-byte transfers succeeded (Fix #6 worked)
- 512-byte transfers still timed out
- DMA counter stuck: `CUBC=00000001`
- DMA callback result=-4 (timeout)

**Why This Bug Was Hidden:**
Fix #1 in `sam_hsmci.c` invalidated the cache, but then `sam_dmarxsetup()` in `sam_xdmac.c` called clean, which:
1. Re-allocated the cache lines
2. Created a race condition with DMA
3. Caused CPU to read stale cached data instead of DMA-written data

**Fix Applied:**
```c
/* FIX #7: Invalidate D-cache for RX DMA buffer (not clean!)
 * CRITICAL: For receive DMA (peripheral->memory), we must INVALIDATE
 * the cache, not clean it. Clean is for TX DMA (memory->peripheral).
 * Using clean here was re-allocating cache lines after they were
 * invalidated by the caller, causing cache/memory incoherency.
 * This bug caused 512-byte DMA transfers to timeout.
 */

up_invalidate_dcache(maddr, maddr + nbytes);
```

**BEFORE (WRONG):**
```c
up_clean_dcache(maddr, maddr + nbytes);  // Wrong for RX!
```

**AFTER (CORRECT):**
```c
up_invalidate_dcache(maddr, maddr + nbytes);  // Correct for RX!
```

**Verification:**
- Matches ARM Cortex-M7 cache coherency requirements
- Complements Fix #1 (double invalidation is safe)
- Eliminates cache re-allocation race

**Cache Operations Reference:**
| Operation | Function | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Clean | `up_clean_dcache()` | TX DMA: Write cache→memory before DMA reads |
| Invalidate | `up_invalidate_dcache()` | RX DMA: Discard cache before/after DMA writes |
| Flush | `up_flush_dcache()` | Clean + Invalidate (rarely needed) |

### Bug #8: Wrong Cache Operation in XDMAC DMA Start

**File:** `platforms/nuttx/NuttX/nuttx/arch/arm/src/samv7/sam_xdmac.c`
**Line:** 2226 (after fix)
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Cache incoherency, DMA timeout despite Fix #7

**Root Cause:**
Even after Fix #7 corrected the cache operation in `sam_dmarxsetup()`, there was ANOTHER cache bug in `sam_dmastart()`. At line 2224, the code called:

```c
up_flush_dcache(xdmach->rxaddr, xdmach->rxaddr + xdmach->rxsize);
```

This was **RE-ALLOCATING cache lines** that Fix #7 had just invalidated!

**The Problem Sequence:**
1. `sam_dmarxsetup()` called → **Fix #7** invalidates cache ✓
2. DMA descriptors configured
3. `sam_dmastart()` called → **Bug #8** flushes cache (clean+invalidate) ✗
4. The **clean** part of flush re-allocates cache lines!
5. DMA runs but cache coherency is broken again
6. Result: `CUBC=00000001` (last 4 bytes stuck)

**Why Flush Is Wrong:**
- **Flush** = Clean + Invalidate
- **Clean** writes cache to memory (for TX DMA only!)
- For **RX DMA**, we should NEVER clean
- We already invalidated in setup, just need to invalidate again (not clean!)

**Symptoms:**
- Test with Fixes #1-7: `CUBC=00000001` (512-byte transfer timeout)
- HSMCI shows `XFRDONE=1` (peripheral done)
- But last 4 bytes never reached memory via DMA

**Fix Applied:**
```c
/* FIX #8: For RX DMA (peripheral->memory), ONLY invalidate (not flush!)
 * CRITICAL: Flush = clean + invalidate, but RX DMA should never clean.
 * The clean operation re-allocates cache lines after sam_dmarxsetup()
 * already invalidated them, causing cache/memory incoherency.
 * We only need invalidate to ensure CPU reads fresh DMA data.
 */

if (xdmach->rx)
  {
    up_invalidate_dcache(xdmach->rxaddr, xdmach->rxaddr + xdmach->rxsize);
  }
```

**BEFORE (WRONG):**
```c
up_flush_dcache(xdmach->rxaddr, xdmach->rxaddr + xdmach->rxsize);
```

**AFTER (CORRECT):**
```c
up_invalidate_dcache(xdmach->rxaddr, xdmach->rxaddr + xdmach->rxsize);
```

**Verification:**
- Matches ARM Cortex-M7 cache coherency requirements
- Double invalidation (setup + start) is safe and recommended
- Eliminates all cache clean operations from RX DMA path

**Test Result:**
Still failed with `CUBC=00000001`, revealing that cache wasn't the only issue (see Bug #9).

### Bug #9: DMA Chunk Size Too Small

**File:** `platforms/nuttx/NuttX/nuttx/arch/arm/src/samv7/sam_hsmci.c`
**Lines:** 140, 145
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Last microblock not transferred, DMA stalls

**Root Cause:**
The HSMCI DMA chunk size was set to **1 word** (4 bytes), meaning a DMA request is generated for EVERY 4 bytes of data. For a 512-byte transfer, that's 128 separate DMA requests. The last DMA request (#128) was not being reliably generated or serviced, causing `CUBC=00000001` (last microblock stuck).

**Why Chunk Size 1 Failed:**
With such a small chunk size:
1. HSMCI peripheral finishes reading from SD card
2. Sets `XFRDONE` flag (thinks transfer complete)
3. But last 4 bytes still in FIFO
4. Last DMA request may not trigger before timeout
5. XDMAC shows `CUBC=1` (1 microblock = 4 bytes remaining)

**Symptoms:**
- 8-byte transfers: SUCCESS with chunk size 1
- 512-byte transfers: FAIL with `CUBC=00000001`
- HSMCI shows `SR=08000027` (XFRDONE=1, transfer done from card perspective)
- DMA callback gets result=-4 (-EINTR) from timeout handler

**Initial Fix Attempt (FAILED):**
Changed chunk size from 1 to 16 words (64 bytes):
```c
#define HSMCI_DMA_CHKSIZE HSMCI_DMA_CHKSIZE_16  // TOO LARGE!
```

**Result:** Made things WORSE!
- 8-byte transfers: NOW FAILING with `CUBC=00000001`
- 512-byte transfers: `CUBC=0000007f` (127 microblocks = 508 bytes remaining!)

**Revised Fix (CURRENT):**
Changed chunk size to **4 words** (16 bytes) as a compromise:
```c
/* FIX #9 REVISED: Use moderate chunk size of 4 words (16 bytes)
 * Chunk size 1 causes last microblock issues for 512-byte transfers
 * Chunk size 16 is too large for 8-byte transfers
 * Chunk size 4 is a good compromise for both small and large transfers
 */
#define HSMCI_DMA_CHKSIZE HSMCI_DMA_CHKSIZE_4
```

And in DMA flags:
```c
DMACH_FLAG_PERIPHCHUNKSIZE_4  // Was: PERIPHCHUNKSIZE_1
```

**Why Chunk Size 4 Should Work:**
- **8-byte transfer:** 8/16 = 0.5 chunks (DMA triggers when any data available)
- **512-byte transfer:** 512/16 = 32 DMA requests (much more reliable than 128)
- Reduces timing sensitivity
- More efficient (fewer interrupts)

**Verification:**
- Build timestamp: Nov 22, 2025 14:14
- Awaiting test results

**Math Comparison:**
| Chunk Size | Chunk Bytes | 8-byte xfer | 512-byte xfer |
|------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 (original) | 4 | 2 requests ✓ | 128 requests ✗ |
| 16 (first try) | 64 | 0.125 requests ✗ | 8 requests ✗ |
| 4 (revised) | 16 | 0.5 requests ? | 32 requests ? |

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why These Bugs Existed

1. **Incomplete ARM Cortex-M7 Cache Support:**
   - NuttX SAMV7 driver ported from SAMA5 (Cortex-A5, no data cache)
   - Cache coherency requirements not added during port

2. **Hardware Header Error:**
   - BLKR field definitions incorrect since initial commit
   - Not caught because no testing on real hardware

3. **Generic XDMAC Driver:**
   - XDMAC driver is generic (used by SPI, I2C, UART)
   - Clean operation works for bidirectional peripherals
   - HSMCI has distinct RX/TX paths requiring different cache operations

### Why They Weren't Caught Earlier

1. No automated testing on SAMV71 hardware
2. Most NuttX SAMV7 users don't use SD cards
3. Cache issues are timing-dependent and hard to debug
4. Hardware register errors require datasheet verification

---

## Prevention Measures

### Code Review Checklist

When porting drivers to Cortex-M7 with data cache:

- [ ] Add D-cache invalidation before RX DMA

- [ ] Check all cache operations match transfer direction
- [ ] Verify hardware register definitions against datasheet
- [ ] Test on real hardware with various transfer sizes
- [ ] Add assertions for block parameter validity
- [ ] Document cache coherency requirements

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Test with 8-byte, 64-byte, 512-byte transfers
- [ ] Test multi-block transfers
- [ ] Monitor BLKR register values during operation
- [ ] Check DMA counter registers (CUBC, CBC)
- [ ] Verify file system integrity after mount
- [ ] Test with different SD card speeds (DS, HS)
